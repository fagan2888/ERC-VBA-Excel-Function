# CCD ALGORITHM
##Application to EU Style Factors
##ERC or RISK PARITY portfolios
##In Excel VBA

This short project is a direct application of the Juan-Carlos Richard and Thierry Roncalli article available on ssrn. The cyclical coordinate descent (CCD) they describe is a fantastic tool in that you can solve many convex optimization problems without the need for an optimiser/solver, just using an iterative algorithm.

We apply here the cyclical coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm to compute the weight of the ERC portfolio in an Excel VBA framework.
